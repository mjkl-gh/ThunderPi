Driver and Userspace SDK for Boltek Lightning Detector
-------------------------------------------------------

Kernel Module
------------

First, you need to install the device driver.

cd driver
make
cp 77-boltek.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

If that fails you need to install the development headers for the
kernel you are running.

apt-get install linux-headers on debian or ubuntu
yum install kernel-headers on redhat or centos

check /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build for existence as a test that they
are installed.

boltek.ko is the kernel module. Install as "insmod boltek.ko". Putting
this in /etc/rc.local is a good idea.

As with all kernel modules, if you update your kernel you will need to
rebuild the module.

run dmesg and you should see something along the lines of:
Boltek Lightning Detector started at /dev/lightning-0 major 252 minor 0

and ls -l /dev/lightning-0 will show
crw-rw-rw- 1 root 252, 0 2008-06-25 09:56 /dev/lightning-0

Note that the device is created with access permissions for everybody
(0666). This can be changed in the 77-boltek.rules file you
installed. The default permissions if that is not installed are 0660
and only root can use the device.

If you are not running udev then the device file is not created for
you at all. You can make the device by hand by doing "mknod
/dev/lightning-0 c 252 0". The minor number is always 0 but the major
number is dynamically assigned and may change each time you insmod the
driver. The major number can be found either in that log message or
/proc/devices - udev is found on modern Linux distributions and is the
preferred way of doing things.

Userspace Library
-------------------

libboltek.c - the userspace library source
stormpci.h  - The header file for libboltek using applications which
	      defines the API
demo.c      - An example application using libboltek

To build the libraries and demo application

cd libboltek
make

These new files are produced:

libboltek.so - the compiled userspace library as a shared library 
libboltek.a  - the compiled userspace library as a static library
demo

the libboltek library depends on the math library, so be sure to add
-lm to any linker command that uses libboltek.[so|a]

Run demo as ./demo
